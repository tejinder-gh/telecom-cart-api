.claude/api.md is a trimmed version of my api specification template file I generally use for my AI-assistant. For your context, I have removed elements such as:
- API versioning
- db related
- authentication related
- some error handling specifications
- middlewares related
- request tagging
- audit logging
- request lifecycle management including time tracking
- rate limiting
- some of the health checks such as db ping and redis ping
